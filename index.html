    <p>Above is a histogram I created that displays Albert Pujol's annual numbers of career doubles throughout his career in baseball. The histogram that I have created displays the distribution of the data.</p>
    <p>A distrubution includes a set of variables and the values they take on (Pujol's annual number of doubles) and the frequency (the number of times he got a certain number of annual doubles). </p>
    <p>In terms of the levels (or central tendencies for this data set), I found the mean to be approximately 34, the median to be about 37, and the mode to be 51. The spread of the data is relatively far apart as the standard deviation is 11. This means that there is a wide range of numbers around the central point. </p>
    <p>In terms of the shape, the histogram is skewed left because the left hand tail is pulled out further. This is supported visually and numerically as the mean is less than the median. In terms of outliers, it does not appear that there are any. While there is a large range of numbers, none of the numbers lie outside of the normal distribution.</p>
